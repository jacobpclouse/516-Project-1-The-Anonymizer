replaceChar = user input char (ie: X)

stringToReplace = user input

censoredString = ""; 

Replacement string = for loop
    (i = 0, i < StringToReplace.length, i++){
        censoredString += replacechar;
            This should give us a string that is the same length as the word we want to censor but it is made 
            up entirely of the replacement charater that we are subsitituting in. ie: XXXXX
    }

if text = string then
